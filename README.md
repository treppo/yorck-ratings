This a simple client side Javascript experiment to try out a few different
approaches to handling asynchronous operations, namely ES6 Promises (native
in modern browsers), ES7 asyncâ€“await functions (with [Babeljs](https://babeljs.io/)) and channels 
(with [Js-csp](https://github.com/ubolonton/js-csp)), and latest via Future monad.
